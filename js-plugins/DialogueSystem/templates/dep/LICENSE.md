    About fanworks/fan art:

    Yes! Fanworks and fan art is allowed of any content I ever make!
    I also allow the distribution of fanworks through conventions and fan-markets, 
    but please do not label them as official works!
    Thank you for liking my work enough to make such works..!

    Use of my works on Social media: 

    You may use any of my personal works as icons, headers and etc for use on
    any social media, however please do not claim that any of these works are yours!
    This also only applies to works for my personal works, this does not extend 
    to commercial projects I've worked on for any of my clients.
